+ Raw Data: we have the original data (.bag) of 4 scenarios:
1. PM
2. PA
3. ES
4. Ushape

+ Data Extract: we have two algorithms:
- messageExtract: to extract and save information from bag file
         Input: bag file
         Output: msg data (.mat)
- ExtractAlignedData: to do alignement between modalities and than save Aligned data.
         Input: msg data (.mat)
         Output: genSyncdata (.mat)

+ Generated Data: Where generated and alignement information are saved for each scenario.

Since this work compares two different approaches for modeling 
the interaction of multi-sensorial informatio:

+  Separately Technique
+  Jointly Technique
+  With alpha and beta
