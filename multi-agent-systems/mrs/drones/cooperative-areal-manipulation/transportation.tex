		Highlights
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Multiple MAVs mechanically coupled.
			\item Uses spherical joints
			\item doesn’t require force/torque sensors
			\item decentralized
			\item doesn’t rely on communication between agents and can be easily extended to multiple MAVs
			\item  spherical joint, which guarantees attitude decoupling among agents and payload
			\item kinetically constraints the translational dynamic of each agent to be the same as the motion of the payload
			\item The task of the master is to lead and steer the group of vehicles connected to the payload towards a desired destination, while keeping a constant transportation altitude.
			\item The slaves are not aware of the destination goal, but share the same altitude of the master, assisting their leader in the transportation task.
			\item  Cooperation and coordination of the slave agents with respect to the movements of the master is achieved via re-
			shaping the apparent physical properties of each slave, in order that maximum compliance to the actions of the master is guaranteed.
			\item modify the inertial properties of each slave MAV to make it behave as a \textbf{passive point-mass},
			accelerated by any interaction force applied on it and subject to viscous friction directly proportional to its own velocity. This new behavior can be achieved by means of \textbf{admittance control}.
			\item The key idea behind admittance control is that a \textbf{position-controlled mechanical system} can achieve arbitrary
			interaction dynamics by sensing the force coming from the environment and by accordingly generating and following
			a reference trajectory. In order to do so, every slave agent is equipped with a force estimator, which senses the force
			applied by the master to the payload. This force information is then used by the admittance controller to regulate the
			position of the slave agent, so that it guarantees maximum possible compliance to the estimated force.
			\item In a collaborative transportation maneuver, the master MAV agents behaves as if it was carrying the payload
			alone, pulling it towards the desired goal while keeping a \textbf{constant altitude}. For this reason it only executes its on-board \textbf{reference tracking feedback loop}. The reference trajectory which leads it to the destination goal can be provided by a user or by an on-board or off-board planning system.
			\item Information is instead shared via the payload itself, which is used as a medium to transfer the interaction force
			applied by the master to the slaves. This information flow is mono-directional, from the master to the slaves, as the slaves
			fully act according to the sensed force applied by the master on the transported structure, while the master executes its
			standard reference tracking algorithms.
			\item agents (a) do not have to agree on a \textbf{global inertial reference frame} 
			\item do not need to share the destination goal. This is made possible by the fact that each slave on-line generates
			a reference trajectory in the same frame as the external forces are estimated. The destination goal has to be known only by
			the master and, as a consequence, has to be expressed in the master’s reference frame only.
			
			\item the agents can grasp the payload in such a way that its weight force can be equally distributed among the
			agents.
			
		\end{itemize}
		\paragraph{Reaching the transportation altitude / taking off and landing}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A centralized Finite State Machine (FSM) sends altitude increment commands $\Delta h$ to both the agents and make
				sure they both fulfill the command.
			\end{itemize}
		\paragraph{Agents low level architecture}
			\subparagraph{State estimator}
			\subparagraph{Position and attitude controller}
		\paragraph{Slave-specific control architecture}
			\subparagraph{Force estimator}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Force estimates can be obtained from the sole inertial information provided by the on-board IMU and the state estimator
					\item combined with the measurement of the rotational speed of the rotors
				\end{itemize}
			\subparagraph{Admittance controller}
				 generates an on-line reference trajectory (position, velocity, attitude and angular velocity) for the position and attitude controller, given the estimate of the external force.
